 		An artist, creative thinker and writer, that is a Computer scientist.
 	<hr></hr>
It all began at the age of 7 years old, where l decided to put a pen on white paper, in class at creative period. A thought came to mind that l could be a “published author”, funny enough, if l went and photocopied what l wrote, then my book would be published! Don’t worry it was already signed and sealed, so it’s definitely copyrighted whereever it is. I look back and think what level of stupidity was l in?
<hr></hr>
Gradually l matured into teenagehood, fast forward when we had to choose subjects for grade 10(FET Phase). An interest for technology caught my attention, at school the only subject related to that was CAT(Computer applications technology). I then decided to choose it as an elective, later when our LO teacher was discussing with us the benefits of each subject. We were told the APS (Admission point score) did not include CAT as a subject. Trust me, l was shattered.
So l continued without it, and chose geography, mind you l ended up being good at this subject. My teacher recommend l study GIS at tertiary, l applied but was not admitted. I am glad this happened because my brother had suggested l study IT instead, since l did not get the chance to learn CAT. I then grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Today l am studying IT. What was an interest influenced my reality.
<hr></hr>
Artificial intelligence is the aspect that will shift the youth’s mindest into engineering, l believe so. I am currently interested in data science, mind you, exploring online courses is the best way to learn, for me. I have enrolled myself at DataCamp, where they teach everything data science. What l did not mention earlier was, l also have an interest in mathematics, in which l am still pursuing. In order to write a good book, a great depth of knowledge is required. Therefore l read success books, but not to lie, l don’t finish them all. My personal favourite is “The Compound Effect”, in summary the book’s message is “small amounts of efforts, grow exponentially overtime, having a huge impact in your life”.
<hr></hr>
That is what l live by, starting small, then eventually with time grow into something big. In short, l might not have the best academic marks and experience required by any industry. Though I am certain that l have the willingness to acquire a skill. And my journey in coding has just began.
