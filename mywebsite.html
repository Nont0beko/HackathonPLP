			Through out my journey of self discovery, l have learnt that what truly
			matters is building yourself. No competiion is needed with this, you develop
			a sense of self worth and confidence. You are here to thrive to be the best 
			version of yourself and not a replica of some sort. These books have helped 
			me to search deep within, connect with self and readjust.
